# AudioSynthesis
In this report, we presented a way to make our target speaker say any translated content in a language where one has never spoken while maintaining the target speaker's voice and appropriate accent for the language. Our final models consist of the combination of translation and audio synthesis parts.

### Audiosynthesis part
ipynb shows getting target speaker features

### Translation part
We benefit from ESPnet and Multilingual TTS papers for the translation part

translation_audiosynthesis.ipynb shows how we generated outputs in the Translation_project
