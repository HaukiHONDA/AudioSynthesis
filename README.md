# AudioSynthesis
In this report, we presented a way to make our target speaker utter any translated content in a language where one has never spoken while maintaining the target speaker's voice and appropriate accent for the language.

### Audiosynthesis part
Audiosynthesis_Obama.ipynb and Audiosynthesis_Oprah.ipynb shows getting target speaker features

### Translation part
We benefit from ESPnet and Multilingual TTS papers for the translation part

translation_audiosynthesis.ipynb shows how we generated outputs in the Translation_project (From English speech input to French speech output with target speaker voice)
